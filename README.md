# Flood

Flood is a game where you fill a grid from the top left corner until the grid is all the same color.

I intend to develop the game much further and also to provide a theoretical underpinning for it. 

Questions to answer:
1. What is the expected solution length from a theoretical standpoint? What is the dependence on the number of colors? 
2. Is a greedy algorithm optimal? 
3. What happens if the game has a clumpiness instead of uniform color distribution?
